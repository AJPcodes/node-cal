# node-cal
Node Cal NSS Student Workspace

This is a project completed at NSS.

The goal was to practice Node.js with ES6 and TDD by creating an exact replica of the UNIX command line app 'cal.'
It uses Zeller's algorithm to generate a ASCII calendar and correctly handle leap years etc. Users can choose to lookup a specific month or year.

The project implements unit and integration tests with Mocha and Chai.

This is the command line version of the app, and you're welcome to fork and pull it down to test it out. 
(You will need to do an npm install to get lodash) then just run `node cal.js`

However, I've used it as a module on a heroku-deployed student project so you can see the functionality here:
